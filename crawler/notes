Initial Idea:
- Input: file path
- Routes to correct language handler, finds imports and spits them out

Currently using local filesystem as the "database", would like this to be 
agnostic though. Create this in a way that this can work even in a remote
storage (Github, Gitlab, S3, ec2 instance's filesystem, etc.) 

Then that means this is an adapter you attach to a file storage.

Also would like to get a window tiling/tab system in the web client to more easily
view these files together
